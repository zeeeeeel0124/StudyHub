# StudyHub
StudyHub is a centralized platform designed to enhance online and hybrid learning in higher education. It addresses common challenges such as student disengagement and difficulty accessing resources by providing instructors with tools to share materials effectively. A standout feature is the integrated note-taking function, which allows students to create and organize notes within the system, promoting collaboration and improving academic performance. Additionally, students can view upcoming content that instructors plan to add, ensuring they stay informed and engaged. This project aims to foster better organization and communication among students and instructors alike.
